    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing has emerged as an  irreplaceable tool for monitoring floods and accessing their impact on the environment. One widely used technique is the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) which uses satellite images to detect and quantify water bodies. This work hopes to highlight also the application of the NDWI in flood monitoring and what emaphasis have been out on open science in such a field. The NDWI utilizes the spectral characteristics of water to seperate its pixels from other land cver types by using the spectral bands and calculates the NDWI to delineates water bodies. Through the use of the NDWI, flooded areas can be identified and the extent of flooded pixels can also be estimated. the accuracy of such a method has been tested world wide by varying researchers for such an exercise. The use of NDWI for flood monitoring also lays out the principles of open science practices through transparent sharing of data, methods and results which helps incubate collaboration and reproducibility which enables researchers to validate findings, compare existing methods and easily build upon existing knowledge."

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Flood monitoring can be regarded as one of the vital aspects of distater management and remote sensing techniques have made gathering of data much easier than insitu observations. As floods are just one of the many occuring natural distasters, their occurance cannot be prevented but loss of life can be prevented by such remote sensing techiques. More information about floods can be found on [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkids.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fflood&psig=AOvVaw1be5uxZf03q3fkBU0a7uzS&ust=1679145328989000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCND0ufyF4_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). Freely available satellite data from satellites such as Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel can be utilized in this instance. More data about remote sensing and flood mapping can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100697). An index known as the [Normalized difference Water Index](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14236005) (NDWI) can be utilized to delineate the flooded areas which creates a distinction between the water pixels and other land features in the area for easy mapping of pixels covered with water (Ogilvie et al.,2018)"

    "The theoretical grounds of use of the NDWI are based on the face that the reflection from the chosen bands are significantly high enough to allow descrimination from background non water pixels. The science behind the use of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for flood monitoring lies in its ability to exploit the spectral properties of water in satellite imagery. NDWI is based on the principle that water absorbs and scatters light differently compared to other land cover types, allowing for its differentiation and mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "NDWI is typically calculated using the near-infrared (NIR) and green (G) bands of multispectral satellite imagery. These bands are sensitive to the reflectance characteristics of water. The formula for NDWI is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<font><center>$NDWI = (NIR - G) / (NIR + G)$<font/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting NDWI values range from -1 to +1, where higher positive values indicate a higher likelihood of water presence. Positive values correspond to the strong reflectance of NIR light by water and the absorption of G light. On the other hand, negative values indicate the dominance of land cover types with high reflectance in the green band. In flood monitoring, NDWI is applied to satellite imagery captured during and after flood events. By calculating NDWI values for each pixel in the imagery, areas with high positive NDWI values can be identified as potential water bodies. These areas can be further analyzed and classified to determine the extent and boundaries of the flood.\n",
    "\n",
    "NDWI is particularly effective in flood monitoring due to its sensitivity to water content and its ability to differentiate water bodies from other land cover types. It enables the detection of flooded areas, even when they are partially covered by vegetation or in urban environments. Additionally, NDWI allows for the monitoring of flood dynamics over time by comparing NDWI values from different satellite images captured during different phases of the flood event (Memon et al., 2015)."

    "The NDWI is a widely used remote sensing index for flood events. NDWI leverages the spectral characteristics of water in near-infrared (NIR) and green (G) bands to differentiate water from other land cover types. By quantifying the water content in an area, the NDWI can provide valuable insights into the extent and dynamics of floods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the significant advantages of NDWI is its ability to utilize freely available Landsat satellite data, which has been made accessible through open science practices. Landsat satellites provide consistent and high-quality multispectral imagery, allowing for long-term monitoring and analysis of flood events. Open science practices, such as data sharing and open-source software, have facilitated the widespread adoption of NDWI and enhanced collaboration among researchers and practitioners (Zheng et al., 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of NDWI in flood monitoring offers several benefits. First, it enables the identification and delineation of water bodies, aiding in flood extent mapping and flood risk assessment. The index can be applied to multiple satellite images captured over time to monitor the progression of flood events and assess changes in water levels. This information is crucial for disaster management and emergency response planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the use of open science practices for Landsat data promotes transparency and reproducibility. Researchers can freely access and analyze Landsat data, ensuring the transparency of data sources and methodologies. Open-source software, such as QGIS or commercial ones like ArcGIS, provides powerful tools for processing and analyzing large-scale satellite imagery, making it accessible to a broader community of users."

    "In conclusion, NDWI, coupled with open science practices for Landsat data, plays a vital role in flood monitoring. It enables accurate and timely assessment of flood events, supports decision-making processes, and fosters collaboration among researchers and stakeholders. The use of NDWI and open science practices contributes to more effective and informed flood management strategies, enhancing our understanding of these natural disasters and facilitating resilience in flood-prone regions. Ultimately, the use of NDWI from Landsat 8 within the framework of open science principles provides a robust foundation for evidence-based decision making, sustainable water management practices, and informed policy development. It enables a broader community of researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to actively engage in water resource studies and collectively work towards the preservation and sustainable use of water resources."
