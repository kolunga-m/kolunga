    "## Introduction\n",
    "Flood monitoring can be regarded as one of the vital aspects of distater management and remote sensing techniques have made gathering of data much easier than insitu observations. As floods are just one of the many occuring natural distasters, their occurance cannot be prevented but loss of life can be prevented by such remote sensing techiques. More information about floods can be found on [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkids.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fflood&psig=AOvVaw1be5uxZf03q3fkBU0a7uzS&ust=1679145328989000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCND0ufyF4_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). Freely available satellite data from satellites such as Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel can be utilized in this instance. More data about remote sensing and flood mapping can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100697). An index known as the [NOrmalized difference Water Index](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14236005) (NDWI) can be utilized to delineate the flooded areas which creates a distinction between the water pixels and other land features in the area for easy mapping of pixels covered with water."

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With high end commercial and freely available software, anybody can typically do such analysis. Commercial software such as ArcMap and matlab cab be used to work with the raster from the satellites. And i cases whether the user does not have access to such commercial software, other freely available software such as QGis aand Python can be used to process the rasters. The main method of producing such data to monitor these flooded areas makes use of the Normalized Difference vegetation Index. This reporsetory would like to stick to use of Landsat imagery to do flood monitoring using the NDWI, by using Band3 (Green) and Band5 (Near infrared).<p>"
